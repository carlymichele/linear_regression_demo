# Predicting House Prices
### A case study with SciKit Learn and Pandas

This is my linear regression model for predicting housing prices based on a variety of home attributes.

I trained my model by randomly splitting the data into a training set (70%) and test set (30%).

I received my materials from the Metis Intro to Regression Day Bootcamp: https://www.meetup.com/Metis-San-Francisco-Data-Science/
